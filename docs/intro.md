# SAND: The Stack for the Decentralized Web

**LAMP built the open web. SAND builds the decentralized one.**

In the 2000s, LAMP (Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP) gave developers a complete stack for building open source web applications. It was simple, modular, and changed everything.

SAND is the stack for the next era: **Solid, ActivityPub, Nostr, DID**. Four protocols that work together to create a web where users own their data and agents serve their interests.

## The Stack

| Layer | Protocol | Purpose |
|-------|----------|---------|
| **S** | [Solid](/protocols/solid) | Decoupled data & apps. Store in pods you control. |
| **A** | [ActivityPub](/protocols/activitypub) | Federated social. Follow anyone, post anywhere. |
| **N** | [Nostr](/protocols/nostr) | Censorship-resistant messaging. Cryptographic identity. |
| **D** | [DID](/protocols/did) | Decentralized identity. Self-sovereign, portable. |

## Why SAND?

The current web has a problem: your data is scattered across hundreds of silos, each controlled by a different corporation. Your identity is fragmented. Your social graph is locked in.

SAND fixes this:

- **Your data in one place** — Solid pods store your data, apps request access
- **Federated social** — ActivityPub lets you follow anyone across servers
- **Censorship-resistant** — Nostr can't be shut down or controlled
- **Portable identity** — DIDs work everywhere, no vendor lock-in

## Quick Start

Get a complete SAND server running locally:

```bash
npx sandymount
```

This gives you:
- A Solid pod for your data
- Nostr relay integration
- Built-in identity provider
- Git HTTP backend

See the [Getting Started Guide](/guides/your-first-pod) for more.

## The Vision

We're building the **open, agentic, decentralized web** — where:

- Users own their data
- Agents serve their interests
- Protocols are open
- Networks are federated
- Identity is self-sovereign
