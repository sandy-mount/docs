# BlockTrails

**Provably safe agents via Bitcoin state anchoring.** Full audit trail. Trust through time.

## How It Works

Agent behavior is cryptographically anchored to Bitcoin:

1. Agent takes action
2. Action is logged and hashed
3. Hash is anchored to Bitcoin
4. Anyone can verify the audit trail

## Why Bitcoin?

- Immutable timestamping
- Decentralized verification
- Long-term availability
