# Agentic Alliance

**Coalition for ethical AI agents.** Open standards, user-first design, transparent behavior.

## The Challenge

AI agents are becoming powerful intermediaries between people and the digital world. Without guardrails:

- **Agents could serve platforms** — Optimizing for engagement, not user needs
- **Behavior could be opaque** — Users can't see what agents do on their behalf
- **Data could be exploited** — Agents with access to personal data could abuse it
- **Lock-in could deepen** — Proprietary agents tied to specific ecosystems

The Agentic Alliance exists to prevent this future.

## Mission

Ensure AI agents serve users, not platforms. Establish open standards for:

- **Transparency** — Users can see what agents do
- **Accountability** — Clear responsibility when things go wrong
- **User control** — Users direct agent behavior
- **Data sovereignty** — Users own their data, always
- **Interoperability** — Agents work across platforms

## Core Principles

The Alliance upholds the [Nine Principles](/manifesto/principles) of the Agentic Web:

| Principle | Meaning |
|-----------|---------|
| 1. User First | Agents exist to serve users |
| 2. Verifiable Identity | Know who you're dealing with |
| 3. Data Sovereignty | Your data stays yours |
| 4. Open Protocols | No walled gardens |
| 5. Local-First | Works offline, syncs when online |
| 6. Transparent Logic | See how decisions are made |
| 7. Sustainable Ecosystems | Value creation, not extraction |
| 8. Community Standards | Built together, openly |
| 9. Safety Through Time | Trust earned, not claimed |

## What We Do

### Standards Development

Creating open specifications for:

- **Agent identity** — How agents identify themselves
- **Capability declaration** — How agents describe what they can do
- **Permission protocols** — How agents request and receive permissions
- **Audit trails** — How agent actions are logged
- **Trust frameworks** — How agents build reputation

### Certification Program

Agents can be certified as Alliance-compliant:

```
┌──────────────────────────────────────┐
│  ✓ Agentic Alliance Certified        │
│                                      │
│  Agent: DataHelper v2.1              │
│  ID: did:nostr:npub1abc123           │
│  Certified: 2025-01-15               │
│  Compliance: Full                    │
│                                      │
│  Verified behaviors:                 │
│  • User permission required          │
│  • Actions logged to BlockTrails     │
│  • Data never leaves user's pod      │
│  • Open source implementation        │
└──────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### Advocacy

Promoting ethical agent development through:

- Educational resources
- Industry partnerships
- Policy recommendations
- Public awareness campaigns

## Membership

### For Organizations

Companies building agents can join to:

- Participate in standards development

- Shape the future of ethical AI

## Technical Stack

The Alliance recommends the SAND stack:

| Layer | Technology | Purpose |
|-------|------------|---------|
| Data | **Solid** | User-controlled storage |
| Identity | **DID** | Decentralized identity |
| Communication | **Nostr** / **ActivityPub** | Messaging and federation |
| Trust | **BlockTrails** | Audit trails |
| Agents | **MCP** / **AAM** | Agent protocols |

## Working Groups

### WG-Identity
Agent identity and authentication standards.

### WG-Permissions
Permission request and grant protocols.

### WG-Audit
Logging and verification requirements.

### WG-Trust
Reputation and certification frameworks.

### WG-Interop
