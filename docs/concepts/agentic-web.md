# The Agentic Web

**AI agents should work for you, not for platforms.** The Agentic Web puts intelligent agents in service of users, not corporations.

## The Challenge

AI is transforming how we interact with the web. But there's a risk: if AI agents work for platforms, they'll optimize for platform goals (engagement, ads, data collection), not user goals.

We need agents that:

- **Serve the user first** — Your goals, your priorities
- **Access your data** — With your permission, from your pods
- **Act on your behalf** — Automate tasks, make decisions
- **Are transparent** — You can see what they do and why
- **Are trustworthy** — Provably safe behavior over time

## SAND Enables the Agentic Web

The SAND stack provides the foundation:

### Data Access (Solid)
Agents can read from and write to your pod — with your permission. Your data stays yours.

### Identity (DID)
Agents can verify who you are and act on your behalf using your decentralized identity.

### Communication (Nostr/ActivityPub)
Agents can communicate across the network, federate with other agents, and coordinate actions.

### Trust (BlockTrails)
Agent behavior can be anchored to Bitcoin for provable audit trails — trust through time.

## The Nine Principles

The [Manifesto](/manifesto) defines nine principles for the Agentic Web:

1. **Agents Must Serve the User First**
2. **Identity and Intent Must Be Verifiable**
3. **Data Sovereignty Is Non-Negotiable**
4. **Open Protocols, Not Walled Gardens**
5. **Local-First, Cloud-Optional**
6. **Transparent Logic, Tunable Behavior**
7. **Sustainable Ecosystems Over Extraction**
8. **Community-Driven Standards**
9. **Safety and Trust Through Time**

## Practical Examples

### Personal AI Assistant
An agent that:
- Reads your calendar from your pod
- Checks your preferences
- Books appointments that fit your schedule
- Reports what it did

### Social Feed Curator
An agent that:
- Reads posts from your ActivityPub follows
- Filters based on your criteria (not an algorithm's)
- Highlights what you actually want to see

### Data Steward
An agent that:
- Monitors access to your pod
- Alerts you to unusual requests
- Suggests permission changes

## Key Technologies

### Model Context Protocol (MCP)
[MCP](/projects/mcp) connects AI models to external tools and data. It's how agents access your Solid pod, query data, and take actions.

### BlockTrails
[BlockTrails](/projects/blocktrails) anchors agent behavior to Bitcoin. Over time, an agent builds a verifiable history of safe behavior.

### Web Prompts
[Web Prompts](/projects/web-prompts) standardizes how you instruct agents. Shareable, versionable prompt templates.

### AAM (Agent-to-Agent Manager)
[AAM](/projects/aam) enables agents to discover each other, share capabilities, and collaborate.

## The Vision

Imagine:

- An agent that manages your digital life — across all your data, all your services
- That you can trust because its behavior is auditable
- That you can take with you — it's not locked to any platform
- That works with other people's agents seamlessly

This is the Agentic Web. SAND makes it possible.
