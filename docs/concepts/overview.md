# Core Concepts

The SAND stack is built on several foundational ideas that distinguish it from the centralized web we know today. Understanding these concepts will help you see how the pieces fit together.

## The Big Ideas

### [Data Sovereignty](/concepts/data-sovereignty)
Your data belongs to you. Not to platforms, not to advertisers, not to algorithms. You decide where it lives and who can access it.

### [Federation](/concepts/federation)
Instead of one giant server controlled by one company, federated systems connect many servers run by many people. Like email, but for everything.

### [Decentralized Identity](/concepts/decentralized-identity)
Your identity shouldn't depend on any single company. Decentralized identifiers (DIDs) let you prove who you are without a middleman.

### [Linked Data](/concepts/linked-data)
Data that connects to other data. URLs aren't just for web pages — they can identify anything, and data can link to data across the web.

### [The Agentic Web](/concepts/agentic-web)
AI agents that work for you, not for platforms. Agents that can read your data, act on your behalf, and answer to you.

### [Local-First](/concepts/local-first)
Your apps and data work offline. The cloud is optional. Your device is the source of truth.

## How They Connect

```

Each concept builds on the others:

- **Linked Data** provides the foundation — a way for data to reference other data
- **Data Sovereignty** puts that data under your control
- **Federation** lets independent servers interoperate
- **Decentralized Identity** gives you a portable identity across those servers
- **Local-First** ensures you're not dependent on any server
- **The Agentic Web** brings intelligent agents into this ecosystem

## Next Steps

Start with whichever concept interests you most, or continue to [Data Sovereignty](/concepts/data-sovereignty) to follow the recommended reading order.
